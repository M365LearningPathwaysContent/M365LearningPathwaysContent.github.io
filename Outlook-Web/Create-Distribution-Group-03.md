## Creating a Distribution Group

A new Distribution group requires three items.  A display name that all organization users will see in the contact list.  An alias, which is usually a shorten version of the display name.  Finally, an email address, which must be unique in your organization.  Members of your new distribution group are managed at the bottom of this dialog.
