## Managing a Distribution Group

On the settings dialog, select the "General" settings and then select "Distribution groups."  The Distribution groups screen may take a while to load.  To manage a distribution group and you are the owner of, click on the group you would like to edit and then click on the pencil icon under the "Distribution group I own" heading.
